# Risks & Constraints
## Context
It covers potential challenges that could affect development and delivery of the project. This includes things such as time constraints, technical issues, implementation issues, and more. Scope constraints ensure that we stay focused on building something that is simple and working, rather than an overcomplicated project with features that barely work. By identifying these early, we can create backup plans, and adjust our goals as needed.
