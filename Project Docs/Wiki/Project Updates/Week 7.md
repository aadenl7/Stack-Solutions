## Topic: Project Goals 

### At‑a‑glance: 
| Overall status | % complete (this week) | Top risk (one line) |
|---|---|---|
| On track / May need to catch up a bit though | 65% | Functional homepage that links all features our asset investment site offers. |


### What we shipped/completed this week: 
• Risk assessment quiz 
•  AI Chatbot 


### Evidence & Links (paste URLs): 
•  https://yuoffice.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/YORK-Lab1-G-8/Shared%20Documents/G-8/project%20update%20week%207%20test.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=SATJzA  
•  https://www.jotform.com/agent/019a31c3f0387bae85d2dee1223ec65bda99 


### Decisions made (owner, date): 
• Decided to use Python (quiz.py) for the risk assessment quiz instead of pure JavaScript that is traditionally used with Node as we have not delved into JavaScript yet in our program. (Pranav, September 12, 2025) 

• The quiz will post data to a Node.js Express server (server.js) which acts as a mediator to run the Python script for our quiz (quiz.py).  (October 5, 2025) 

• Deleted and remade a new chatbot due to issues with database logging and chatbot responses. (Aaden, October 20, 2025) 


### Challenges & risks (severity, mitigation): 
•  Ensuring proper responses from AI chatbot (Low severity, low mitigation) 

• Python and Node.js compatibility (low severity, low mitigation) 

•  Properly integrating AI chatbot into figma website (low severity, low mitigation) 


### Plan for next week (task → owner → due date): 
• Complete responsive styling for index.html (Apply styles.css fully, focus on mobile view) Tony 2025-11-03 

• Refine Node.js Error Handling (Specifically for Python script failures/timeouts) Pranav 2025-11-04 

• Integrate Features into user-interface that needs to be designed as well (e.g. Display advice from quiz.py clearly on the page) Everyone, 2025-11-15
