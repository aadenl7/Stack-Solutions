## Topic: Project Goals 

### At‑a‑glance: 
| Overall status | % complete (this week) | Top risk (one line) |
|---|---|---|
| On track / May slightly need to hurry up on implementing the UI and features | 80% | Implementing our features into the homepage |


### What we shipped/completed this week: 
• Completed the website front page 

• Included a news feed for the website front page

### Decisions made (owner, date): 
• Decided to link all app features onto a html homepage for convenient access (Tony, October 25, 2025) 

• Using CSS formatting for all website and UI implementations (Pranav, October 31, 2025) 


### Challenges & risks (severity, mitigation): 
•  a news section and linking different websites (Low severity, low mitigation) 

• Catching up on coding and implementing the features (low severity, low mitigation) 

• Fixing UI and making website user friendly (medium severity, low mitigation) 


### Plan for next week (task → owner → due date):
